Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has and uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. Calculate the amount of money he has after buying the dinner.\nA: Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So he has 4 * 10 + 6 * 20 = 160 dollars. Ali gives half of the total money he has to his sister. So he gives 160 / 2 = 80 dollars to his sister. After giving his sister the money, Ali has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. So he uses 80 * 3/5 = 48 dollars to buy dinner. After buying the dinner, Ali has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left. The answer is 32.\n\nQ: A car is driving through a tunnel with many turns. After a while, the car must travel through a ring that requires a total of 4 right-hand turns. After the 1st turn, it travels 5 meters. After the 2nd turn, it travels 8 meters. After the 3rd turn, it travels a little further and at the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel. If the car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring, how far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn?\nA: It travels 5 meters after the 1st, 8 meters after the 2nd, and 0 meters after the 4th turn. It's a total of 5 + 8 + 0 = 13 meters. The car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring. It travels 13 meters except for the 3rd turn. So it has to travel 23 - 13 = 10 meters after the 3rd turn. The answer is 10.\n\n",
