# ðŸ¤”Reasoners
Reasoners is a toolkit to support advanced reasoning with LLMs, especially tree-structured reasoning (e.g., [RAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14992), [ToT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601), [Guided Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00633), etc.). With Reasoners, it's easy to apply state-of-the-art LLMs (Open-sourced models or OpenAI API) to any problems you want to solve with any reasoning algorithms. The reasoning tree can be visualized with a line of code.

## Why Reasoners?
- **Unified Formulation**: We regard reasoning problems as decision making problems with certian action/state definitions. This formulation covers most popular reasoning algorithms and enable a unified interface for all of them. Users only need to define the state transition and some search configurations to work on a new domain.
- **Visualization**: We provide visualization tools to help users understand the reasoning process. Even for the most complicated reasoning algorithms, e.g. Monte-Carlo Tree Search, users can easily diagnose what happened.
- **LLaMA Integration**: We integrate the state-of-the-art open-sourced LLM: LLaMA, and implement many helper functions, making it as versatile as HuggingFace while as fast as the official implementation.


## Online Demo
> TBA

## Quick Tour
> We need a very short example here, perhaps game of 24?

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ber666/LLM-search
cd LLM-search
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
Note some optional modules (e.g. local visualization) may need other dependencies. Please refer to the error message for details.

## Benchmarks
We tested different reasoning algorithms on first 100 examples of the following benchmarks (To be updated). Superscripted rows indicate the reported results in the original paper.
